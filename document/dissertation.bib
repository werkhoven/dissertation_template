  abstract={Although identified neurons are defined as constant and unique from animal to animal within the same species, we might expect to find phenotypic variablity in the number, morphology, and physiology of identified neurons if we examined them in enough sexually reproduced animals of the same species. Morphological variability and axonal abnormalities were previously encountered in a study of the large ocellar interneurons in 50 grasshoppers. Both the somata and arborizations in the brain of the ocellar interneurons from one or more ocelli~…},

  abstract={Local interneurons are essential in information processing by neural circuits. Here we present a comprehensive genetic, anatomical and electrophysiological analysis of local interneurons {(LNs)} in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe, the first olfactory processing center in the brain. We found {LNs} to be diverse in their neurotransmitter profiles, connectivity and physiological properties. Analysis of\{\textgreater\} 1,500 individual {LNs} revealed principal morphological classes characterized by coarsely stereotyped glomerular~…},

@article{Linneweber_A_2019,
  abstract={The genome versus experience, or Nature versus Nurture, debate has dominated our understanding of individual behavioral variation. A third factor, namely variation in complex behavior potentially due to non-heritable developmental noise in brain development, has been largely ignored. Using the Drosophila vinegar fly we demonstrate a causal link between variation in brain wiring due to developmental noise, and behavioral individuality. A population of visual system neurons called {DCNs} shows non-heritable, inter-individual~â€¦},
